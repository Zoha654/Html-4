                <h3>Facts about tigers</h3>
                <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful,
                muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is
                traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers
                and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.
                
                Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in
                the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent
                and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a
                mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male
                tiger overlaps with that of multiple females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that
                stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's home range and
                establish their own.
                
                Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct
                in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is
                severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to
                have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due
                to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims
                of human–wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is
                legally protected in all range countries. National conservation measures consist of action plans, anti-poaching patrols
                and schemes for monitoring tiger populations. In several range countries, wildlife corridors have been established and
                tiger reintroduction is planned.
                
                The tiger is among the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in captivity since ancient
                times and has been trained to perform in circuses and other entertainment shows. The tiger featured prominently in the
                ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and has continued to appear in culture
                worldwide</p>

                        The tiger has a typical felid morphology, with a muscular body, shortened legs, strong forelimbs with wide front paws, a
                        large head and a tail that is about half the length of the rest of its body.[47][48] It has five digits, including a
                        dewclaw, on the front feet and four on the back, all of which have retractile claws that are compact and curved, and can
                        reach 10 cm (3.9 in) long.[47][49] The ears are rounded and the eyes have a round pupil.[47] The snout ends in a
                        triangular, pink tip with small black dots, the number of which increase with age.[50] The tiger's skull is robust, with
                        a constricted front region, proportionally small, elliptical orbits, long nasal bones and a lengthened cranium with a
                        large sagittal crest.[51][47] It resembles a lion's skull, but differs from it in the concave or flattened underside of
                        the lower jaw and in its longer nasals.[51][43] The tiger has 30 fairly robust teeth and its somewhat curved canines are
                        the longest in the cat family at 6.4–7.6 cm (2.5–3.0 in).[47][52]
                        
                        The tiger has a head-body length of 1.4–2.8 m (4 ft 7 in – 9 ft 2 in) with a 0.6–1.1 m (2 ft 0 in – 3 ft 7 in) tail and
                        stands 0.8–1.1 m (2 ft 7 in – 3 ft 7 in) at the shoulder.[53] The Siberian and Bengal tigers are the largest.[47] Male
                        Bengal tigers weigh 200–260 kg (440–570 lb), and females weigh 100–160 kg (220–350 lb); island tigers are the smallest,
                        likely due to insular dwarfism.[11] Male Sumatran tigers weigh 100–140 kg (220–310 lb), and females weigh 75–110 kg
                        (165–243 lb).[54] The tiger is popularly thought to be the largest living felid species; but since tigers of the
                        different subspecies and populations vary greatly in size and weight, the tiger's average size may be less than the
                        lion's, while the largest tigers are bigger than their lion counterparts
