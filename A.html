                <h2>Facts about pomeranians</h2>
                <p>The Pomeranian (also known as a Pom, Pommy or Pome) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania
                region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small
                size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz.
                
                The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. Queen Victoria owned a particularly
                small Pomeranian, and consequently, the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime
                alone, the size of the breed decreased by half. As of 2017, in terms of registration figures, since at least 1998, the
                breed has ranked among the top fifty most popular breeds in the United States, and the current fashion for small dogs
                has increased their popularity worldwide.</p>
                <aside>
                    <p>Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36–3.17 kilograms (3.0–7.0 lb) and standing 8–14 inches (20–36 cm) high at the
                    withers.[1] They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and
                    flat.[2] The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of
                    feathery hair on the hindquarters.[3]
                    
                    The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red
                    Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century.[4] In modern times,
                    the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange,
                    cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, parti, and blue Merle, plus combinations of those
                    colors.[5] The most common colors are orange, black, and cream/white.[2]</p>
